  <em>Create stunning posters of your favorite albums powered by Spotify's API.</em>
</p>

## üî≠ **Overview**

Posterfy is a web application that allows users to create visually appealing posters for their favorite music albums. Powered by Spotify's free API, Posterfy enables users to search for albums, gather album data, and organize the information into a custom poster using the **HTML Canvas** element.

This project is educational, non-commercial. All rights to the images and data are owned by Spotify and the respective artists.

## üëæ **APIs and Tools Used**

- **[Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/)**: Used to search for albums and retrieve essential information such as album name, artist, and images.
- **[HTML Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial)**: Organizes the collected data visually by rendering it into a poster format using JavaScript on the canvas.

## üîß **How It Works**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Search for Album**: Users enter the name of the album they want to create a poster for.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Select Album**: Posterfy displays search results, and users can select their desired album.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Gathering**: Once the album is selected, Posterfy fetches all the necessary data and images from Spotify's API.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Visual Organization**: The gathered data is then visually organized into a custom layout using the HTML Canvas element.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Poster Generation**: Finally, a rendered image of the poster is generated, which the user can save or share.
